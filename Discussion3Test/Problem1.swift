//Swift Native sorted function by default sorts things either alphabetically or numerically
//Here is an example
//let students: Set = ["Kofi", "Abena", "Peter", "Kweku", "Akosua"]
//let sortedStudents = students.sorted()
//print(sortedStudents)
//Prints "["Abena", "Akosua", "Kofi", "Kweku", "Peter"]"
//As an intro to closures please make a closure that would organize people by from reverse alphabetically / numerical order

func sortedOut(arry: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    
    
    
    return []
}

// After Richard Lyons was elected, he employed Muski Oski to help remove
// unnessary funding at UC Berkeley. Muski Oski hired a group of young
// UC Berkeley engineers to help audit and cut funding programs in the
// ASUC.
// You are one of the engineers!
// Implement the functions below to help Muski Oski to help audit Berkeley


class ASUC {
    var important : Bool = true
    var money : Int = 0
}

// OSKI is the agency that Muski Oski started at Berkeley
// Use the function below to implement a function that cuts funding of programs
// that exceed 100,000 dollars.
// Whether the program was important or not is irrevelant

// This function may be useful
//filter(_:)
//Returns a new collection of the same type containing, in order, the elements of the original collection that satisfy the given predicate.
// Muski is making Berkeley efficient, so he does not allow for loops in this function
// He is efficient!

func OSKI(agency funding : [ASUC]) -> [ASUC] {
    
    
    return []
}


// Muski Oski wants to brag on the internet about how much money, he is saving
// Create a function that squares the amount of money cut from each program and also
// changes the ASUC's program from important to not important
// It is okay to change the money in the class 
// This function below may be useful
//map(_:)
//Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequenceâ€™s elements.
//let cast = ["Vivien", "Marlon", "Kim", "Karl"]
//let lowercaseNames = cast.map { $0.lowercased() }
//'lowercaseNames' == ["vivien", "marlon", "kim", "karl"]
//Also check out a reduce function too
